# ClockPunch
An application that lets you clock in and track time.

There are a surprising number of organizations out there still tracking employee time using paper and pencil. This application is for those organizations to have an easier way to do it, for free. 

## Theres still work to do....

There is still a lot of work to do with ClockPunch. If you would like to contribute for learning purposes or just out of the kindness of your heart, here are a few things I need help with building: 

- Stronger authentication
- Support for Active Directory, Entra ID and other identify services on-prem and cloud-based
- Documentation to help less technical users setup ClockPunch in their environments

If you contribute to ClockPunch in anyway, I will gladly be a reference for you in your job search.
